        Default handler for signin/failure invoke activities.

        Teams sends a signin/failure invoke when SSO token exchange fails
        (e.g., due to a misconfigured Entra app registration). This handler
        logs the failure details and emits an error event so developers are
        notified rather than having the failure silently swallowed.

        **Connection attribution.** A ``signin/failure`` callback does not carry a
        connection name, so the failed connection is recovered from the pending
        sign-in recorded when the flow started — durable state when state is
        enabled, otherwise a short-lived process-local cache. Three outcomes:

            - No flows registered (legacy mode): the default connection is the only
              connection there is, so it is reported as the failed one.
            - A pending sign-in resolves: that flow is reported, and only its
              failure handlers run.
            - Flows are registered but nothing resolves — most commonly because the
              callback reached a different process than the one that started the
              sign-in, and state is not enabled to bridge them. The failed
              connection is genuinely unknown, so the global
              ``SignInFailureEvent.connection_name`` is ``None`` and telemetry omits
              the connection attribute rather than blaming the default. As a
              last resort **every** registered flow's failure handlers are notified,
              each with its own connection name, so no listener silently misses a
              failure that may have been theirs. Enable state to make attribution
              reliable across processes.

        Known failure codes (sent by the Teams client):
            - ``installappfailed``: Failed to install the app in the user's personal
              scope (non-silent).
            - ``authrequestfailed``: The SSO auth request failed after app installation
              (non-silent).
            - ``installedappnotfound``: The bot app is not installed for the user or group chat.
            - ``invokeerror``: A generic error occurred during the SSO invoke flow.
            - ``resourcematchfailed``: The token exchange resource URI on the OAuthCard does
              not match the Application ID URI in the Entra app registration's
              "Expose an API" section.
            - ``oauthcardnotvalid``: The bot's OAuthCard could not be parsed.
            - ``tokenmissing``: AAD token acquisition failed.
            - ``userconsentrequired``: The user needs to consent (handled via OAuth card
              fallback, does not typically reach the bot).
            - ``interactionrequired``: User interaction is required (handled via OAuth card
              fallback, does not typically reach the bot).
