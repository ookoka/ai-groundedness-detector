class IncomingFile:
    """
    A lazy handle to a file attached to the current inbound activity.

    Nothing is downloaded until a byte method is called. The handle stays live and holds no memoized bytes, so each of
    `stream()`/`download()`/`text()`/`save_as()` fetches afresh. For a personal file that re-fetch is bounded by the
    short-lived download URL lifetime and may hit its expiry; to read the same file several ways, call `download()`
    once and reuse the returned `DownloadedFile`.
    """

    unique_id: Optional[str]
    """
    The ODSP/OneDrive identifier for the file when the platform reports it (`content.uniqueId`). Useful for
    correlation, dedup and logging, but not for retrieval: the Graph fetch resolves bytes from `content_url` through
    `/shares`, and this value arrives as a GUID, which is a SharePoint `listItemUniqueId` shape rather than a Graph
    `driveItem.id`. Present only when the wire provided it.
    """

    name: str
    """Display name including extension when known."""

    content_type: Optional[str]
    """
    The file's MIME type when the source provides one. Always `None` for `botActivity` files: a `file.download.info`
    attachment carries no MIME type, only the `file_type` extension surfaced as `extension`. Populated for sources
    that do carry one, such as a `graph` drive item. To learn the type of the bytes you actually received, read
    `DownloadedFile.content_type`, which is resolved from the download response.
    """

    File extension without the dot (e.g. `pdf`), taken from the platform-supplied `file_type`. Absent when the wire
    omits it.

    Browsable URL to the file in OneDrive/SharePoint, as sent on the attachment's `content_url`.

    come from `download()` or `stream()`.
